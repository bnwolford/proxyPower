Scripts used to analyze proxy-cases in population based genome-wide association studies.

## Introduction

Liu et al, 2017 introduced the concept of GWAS by proxy (GWAX): performing case-control genetic association studies using unaffected first-degree relatives of cases (proxy-cases) in the (near) absence of true cases. This was motivated by large population based biobanks such as the UK Biobank with a largely young and healthy population where cases for disease such as Alzheimer's are rare, but relatives of Alzheimer's cases are present. Proxy-cases can be ascertained via self report of family history of disease in survey questionnaires that are frequently a part of biobank enrollment.

The Willer group recognizes that some biobanks, such as HUNT, will have cases and proxy-cases for diseases (e.g. Type 2 diabetes or myocardianl infarction) and has developed tools for accounting for these proxy-cases in various ways. The tools available here are useful for 1) Identifying proxy-cases in your cohort and 2) Running GWAS models that account for them.
